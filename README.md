<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The project is made with ASP.NET Core MVC.First we made the models for the database in the folder models,then we scafolded razor pages for the said models.
After that we made the migrations between the app and the data.Lastly we scafolded the identity for the login and registrations which  is located in the folder Areas.

The file Rent_a_CarDoc.shfbproj is an online documentation file about the whole project.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The application can be used to make a query about a car u would like to rent for a specific amount of time ,u can register and login so u have a personal profile.
We are still working on the feature of authorization so the normal user and the admin are seeing diferent pages.
